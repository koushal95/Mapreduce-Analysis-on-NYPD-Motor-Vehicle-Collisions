Data Analysis on Motor Vehicle Collisions using Map Reduce

This repository contains code to perform data analysis on NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, using map reduce paradigm, that is provided by NYC Open Data. The dataset contains all the reports of vehicular incidents in New York City. More information about the dataset is available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95). The dataset is updated regularly and has a lot of attributes. The aim of the project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset and explore more about the map reduce paradigm. I have used hadoop streaming API and have written the mapper and reducer in python.

Note that I used the standard input for the data to flow in so that I am not restricting any approaches.

If there is anything you want to talk about please reach out. If you find any issues feel free to update them on the issues of this repository.
